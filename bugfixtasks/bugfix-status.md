## ⚠️ Risk Items

### Critical Risks
- [ ] **P0 issues in production** - May already be exploited
  - Mitigation: Immediate hotfix release after each P0 fix
  - Monitoring: Check logs for suspicious activity

- [ ] **Insufficient testing** - Fixes may introduce regressions
  - Mitigation: Mandatory exploit tests, fuzzing, peer review
  - Quality gate: 100% test coverage maintained

- [ ] **Incomplete fixes** - Bypass vulnerabilities possible
  - Mitigation: Security-focused code review
  - Validation: Attempt to bypass each fix

### Medium Risks
- [ ] **Performance degradation** - Security fixes may slow down code
  - Mitigation: Performance benchmarks required
  - Acceptance: <10% performance impact acceptable

- [ ] **Breaking changes** - Fixes may break existing code
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive regression testing
  - Communication: Clear migration guide if needed
